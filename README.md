Project Repository Overview

This repository contains all the files and code for the following two projects:

1. Hematological Image Classification with CNNs

A deep learning project focused on classifying blood cell images.

Key Features:
- Machine learning with InceptionV3, ResNet50, Custom Sequential, and MobileNetV2
- Data preprocessing and real-time augmentation
- Model training with early stopping and checkpointing
- Performance evaluation using:
  - Confusion matrix
  - Classification report
  - Accuracy/loss visualization plots


2. HeartSense: Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Ensemble Learning

A machine learning project that predicts cardiovascular risk from clinical patient data using a custom-built ensemble model.

Project Goals:
- Improve early detection and intervention for heart disease
- Reduce misdiagnosis by increasing model robustness through ensembling

Pipeline Includes:
- Dataset curation and feature selection
- Baseline model evaluation
- Ensemble model construction and optimization
- Visual performance comparison using classification metrics
